# 🖥️ Task 7: Real-Time System & Application Monitoring with Netdata

## 🔍 Overview

This task focuses on **real-time performance monitoring** using **Netdata**, a highly efficient and interactive observability platform. The goal is to deploy a simple application inside a virtual machine (VM), run **Netdata inside Docker**, and explore vital system and container metrics including:

- CPU & memory usage  
- Disk I/O performance  
- Docker container health  
- System alerts and warning rules  

This task is part of a structured learning path designed to give you **practical, hands-on experience** with real-world monitoring tools in a cloud or VM environment.

> 🚀 **Each stage of this task is intentionally crafted as a self-paced lab to help you build practical skills and confidence with monitoring, containerization, and observability workflows.**
